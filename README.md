### Features

Here are the features that `chronos` provides:
- A [UI](https://dkharms.github.io/chronos/benchmarks) with benchmark grouping, filtering, point comparison, and chart screenshots;
- [Summarization](https://github.com/dkharms/chronos/actions/runs/18197908739#summary-51808947342) of pull request benchmarks (and comparison with the latest one) in GitHub Job Summary;

### Rationale

There is at least one GitHub Action that serves the same purpose ([github-action-benchmark](https://github.com/benchmark-action/github-action-benchmark)),
but I was not satisfied with it for several reasons:

- Inconvenient UI with little to no interactivity;
- The parser of benchmark output does not always work correctly and introduces weird units (e.g., `B/op 437 ns/op`);
- The way of configuring the GitHub Action seemed a little cumbersome (but that's very subjective);

### Setting `chronos` up

#### Preconfiguration

Since `chronos` operates on two Git branches (by default these are `chronos-storage` and `gh-pages`),
you need to create and push these branches to the `remote`:

```bash
git checkout --orphan chronos-storage \
  && git commit --allow-empty -m "[chronos] init" \
  && git push origin chronos-storage
```

You must run the same commands for your GitHub Pages branch (if it has not been created yet).

```bash
git checkout --orphan gh-pages \
  && git commit --allow-empty -m "[chronos] init" \
  && git push origin gh-pages
```

#### Action Configuration

Please refer to [this](https://github.com/dkharms/chronos/blob/main/.github/workflows/chronos.yml)
workflow file to understand how to incorporate `chronos` into your GitHub Workflows.
[Here](https://github.com/dkharms/chronos/blob/main/action.yml) you can find what inputs `chronos` expects.

Don't worry - it's dead simple! Just don't forget to pin the [release](https://github.com/dkharms/chronos/releases) version.

### Notes

I should mention that I used AI assistance to build the UI for data visualization (I am far from frontend development),
but I performed common-sense checks of the code that was generated by the LLM - it's perfectly manageable.

### Roadmap

- [x] Support `benchstat` format to mitigate noisy results (https://github.com/dkharms/chronos/issues/13);
- [ ] Support `compare` (?) action which will fail when incoming benchmark results are significantly worse;
- [x] Support option to configure maximum count of data points on charts (https://github.com/dkharms/chronos/pull/17);
